Suppose that we use insertion sort on a randomly ordered array where elements
have only one of three values. Is the running time linear, quadratic, or
something in between?\\[12pt]
}
\def\problemSolution{
\textcolor{blue}{
\textbf{Answer:}\\[6pt]
Worst Case: $O(n^2)$.\\[6pt]Insertion sort might have to go through the items in the array and then shift n times if the array is in descending order.
\\[6pt]However, since we only have 3 distinct randomly ordered array, the running time could be in between because
we might not have to do as many shifts we normally would do on all distinct items.\\[6pt]
