Given an array $A$ of elements that come from a total order, an \emph{inversion}
in $A$ is a pair of elements that are in the wrong order, that is, a pair
$(i,j)$ where $i<j$ and $A[i]>A[j]$. Show that the in-place version of insertion
sort, as given in Algorithm~5.5, runs in $O(n+I)$ time, where $I$ is the number
of inversions in the array $A$.\\[12pt]

\textbf{Answer:}\\[6pt]
The outer for loop runs: n - 1 times (from $i <- 1$ to $n - 1$). \\[6pt]
So we can say that total outer loop's work: O(n)\\[6pt]
The inner while loop runs i times. On worst case we do i shifts. \\[6pt]
Each shift we do, it takes care of one inversion. Therefore, we can say that total shifts = total Inversions = I \\[6pt]
One shift takes O(1) time. \\[6pt]
Since shift = Inversion = I, then we can say that total times =  O(I) for I inversions. \\[6pt]
We can combine the work: \\[6pt]
T(n) = O(n) + O(I)\\[6pt]
T(n) = O(n + I)\\[6pt]
