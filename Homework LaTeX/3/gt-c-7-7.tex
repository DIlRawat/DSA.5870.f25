\def\problemText{
Suppose we implement the tree-based union-find data structure using the
union-by-size heuristic and path-compression heuristics. Show that the total
running time for performing a sequence of $m$ union and find operations,
starting with $n$ singleton sets, is $O(m)$, if $m\ge n\lg n$.\\[12pt]

\textbf{Answer:}\\[6pt]
Theorem 7.6: In a sequence $\alpha$ of m union and find operations performed using
union by size andpath compression, starting with a collection of n single element
sets, the total time to perform the operations in $\alpha$ is $O((n + m)\alpha(n))$.

In the question we are given:  \[m \ge n lgn\]
\[n \le \frac{m}{logn}\]  \\[6pt]
Subsutite in Theorem 7.6 : $T(n,m) = O((n + m)\alpha(n))$ \\[6pt]
\[= O((\frac{m}{logn} + m)\alpha(n))\]\\
\[= O(m(\frac{1}{logn} + 1)\alpha(n))\]\\
\[= O(m(1)(1))\]\\
\[= O(m) \] if $m\ge n\lg n$ \\
