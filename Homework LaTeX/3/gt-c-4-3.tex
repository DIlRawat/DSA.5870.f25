Show by induction that the minimum number, $n_h$ of internal nodes in an AVL
tree of height $h$, as defined in the proof of Theorem~4.1, satisfies the
following identity, for $h\ge1$:
\[n_h=F_{h+2}-1\]
where $F_k$ denotes the Fibonacci number of order $k$ defined in the previous
exercise.\\[12pt]

\textbf{Answer:}\\[6pt]
To show: \[n_h=F_{h+2}-1\]
Base case: $h = 1$\\[6pt]
$n_1 = 1$\\[6pt]
$F_{h+2} - 1 = F_{1+2} - 1 = F_3 - 1 = 2-1 = 1$\\[6pt]
Base case: $h = 2$\\[6pt]
$n_2 = 2$\\[6pt]
$F_{2+2} -1 = F_4 - 1 = 3 -1 = 2$\\[6pt]
Now assume $n_h = F_{h+2} - 1$ for $h = k$ and h = $k - 1$\\[6pt]
To show: $n_{k+1} = F_{k+3} - 1$\\[6pt]
Subsitute $h = k + 1$, $n_{k+1} = F_{k + 3} -1$\\[6pt]
$n_{k - 1} = F_{k+1} - 1 = F_{k - 1} + F_k - 1$ \\[6pt]
Inductive Hypothesis: $n_k = F_{k+2} - 1 = F_k + F_{k+1} - 1$\\[6pt]
From the theorem 4.1 in the book: \\[6pt]
$n_h = 1 + n_{h-1} + n_{h-2}$ \\[6pt]
So, $1 + n_{k-1} + n_{k-2} = F_k + F_{k+1} - 1$ \\[6pt]
$n_{k+1} = 1 + n_k + n_{k-1} = 1 + (F_k + F_{k+1} - 1) + (F_{k-1} + F_k - 1)$\\[6pt]
$ n_{k+1} = F_{k+2} + F_{k+1} - 1$\\[6pt]
$ n_{k+1} = F_{k+3} - 1$ \\[6pt]
Hence, $n_h = F_{n+2} - 1 $
