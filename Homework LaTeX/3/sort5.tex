\textbf{Answer:}\\
Let's say our 5 items are: n1, n2, n3, n4, n5: \\[6pt]
We will divide the first four items into two pairs. Then sort each pair.\\[6pt]
Sort n1 and n2. 1 comparison\\[6pt]
Sort n3 and n4. 1 comparison\\[6pt]
So far we have: $n1 < n2$ and $n3 < n4$ \\[6pt]
\\[6pt]
Now we compare with large items in each pair. n2 and n4. 1 comparison \\[6pt]
If $n2 < n4$: our order: n1, n2, n3, n4 \\[6pt]
    --- We know that: $n1 < n2 < n4$. \\[6pt]
    --- Insert n5. upto 2 comparison\\[6pt]
    --- Then insert n3. upto 2 comparison \\[6pt]
Else: we swap the pairs: n3, n4, n1, n2 \\[6pt]
    --- we know : $n3 < n4 < n2$ \\[6pt]
    --- Insert n5. upto 2 comparison \\[6pt]
    --- Then insert n1. upto 2 comparison \\[6pt]
Result: Sorted sequence: n1, n2, n3, n4, n5\\[6pt]
